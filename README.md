<h1> Installation </h1> <a name="Installation"/>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


<h1> Project Motivation </h1>  <a name="project_mot"/>

What you see in this repository is the result of combining a Udacity course and the determination of a noobie data scientist. 


<h1> File Descriptions </h1> <a name="file_desc"/>

The "Data" folder contains three datasets with Airbnb data for the Boston area. The "Airbnb analysis" notebook contains the code used to analyze certain aspects of the data and answer the 3 business questions described in my post.


<h1> Results </h1> <a name="Results"/>

The main findings of this analysis can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@danielalejandroramos/what-makes-a-good-airbnb-host-3b62648c4f05).


<h1> Acknowledgements </h1> <a name="Acknowledgements"/>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. Special thanks to Udacity as well for providing the knowledge and code examples.
